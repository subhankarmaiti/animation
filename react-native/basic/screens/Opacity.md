# Opacity Explanation

One of the most used animations is opacity. Animating elements visible or animating them hidden. Opacity is a style property that is defined between 0 (meaning hidden) and 1 being completely visible. Anything in between 0 and 1 will add transparency. This will allow you to see through the element and potentially expose other elements underneath.

Opacity is purely visual and operates the same as it does on the web. Meaning the element will have layout, the item just won't be visible. If there is any content behind the element with opacity they will become visible but will not be interactable with.
